From paper:
The results of the experiment provide evidence that that DM do 
have the ability to influence public opinion. This conclusion comes
with a caveat, however. Among observers who are also made aware of
where the major parites stand on the policy issue, the influence of DM 
may be limited to independents.

I think that our project should focus on this and try to
use methods that we have learned in class to dive deeper into this.

around 50% of both treatment and ctrl get party cue, therefore only
about 25% of total get true treatment
